          <h2>How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
          </p>
