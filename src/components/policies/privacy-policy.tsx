          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            At Robin Bril, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you visit our website and tell you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

          <p>
            Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you which we have grouped together as follows:
          </p>
          <ul className="prose-li:text-foreground/90 dark:prose-li:text-foreground/90">

          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>
          <ul className="prose-li:text-foreground/90 dark:prose-li:text-foreground/90">
            <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
            <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Data Security</h2>
          <p>
            We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know.
          </p>

          <h2>Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting requirements.
          </p>

          <h2>Your Legal Rights</h2>
          <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including the right to:</p>
